# Expense-Tracker-Project

## Title
"Dinero" The Expense Tracker App

## Description
The "Dinero" Expense Tracker App will help you organize and track expenses that need to be paid in the future. The user can add and remove different expenses they have in their lives to easily keep up with what they are paying for and how much they need to save to make those payments. Whether it's streaming or gaming subscribtions, or utility payments for your home, keep track of what you are paying for, and what you will need to pay for, can save you a lot of time and stress down the road.

## Technologies Used
This app uses Node.js and Express.js, with Handlebars.js as the tempate engine. We used Materialize and Normalize.CSS as our unique technology that was not taught in class. MySQL and Sequelize are both required to run this app and it follows the MVC paradigm.


## User Story

```
AS A a person who wants to track their expenses
I WANT to be able to create an account and track my expenses
AND I WANT to be able to see what payments are coming up and what needs to be paid soon
SO I can never miss a payment
